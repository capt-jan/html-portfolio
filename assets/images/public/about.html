<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  I embarked on my journey in the nautical industry in 1992, starting as a deckhand on a barge. 
  Through dedication and continuous learning, I progressed to crane operator, then dredge master, 
  and eventually became a captain. Today, I lead the crew of the world’s largest dredging vessel, 
  overseeing complex operations with a strong focus on problem-solving, leadership, and teamwork.

<p>
  While I’ve built a fulfilling career at sea, I have always been passionate about technology, 
  particularly programming. I am fascinated by how technology can create solutions and improve efficiency.
  This curiosity led me to expand my skills beyond the nautical industry.

<h4>Bridging Technology and Sustainability</h4>
<p>
  I am currently pursuing a bachelor’s degree in Environmental Science, where I explore sustainability 
  challenges and ecosystem restoration. In parallel, I am deepening my technical skills through online 
  courses in Python and full-stack web development. My goal is to combine these disciplines—developing 
  digital solutions that contribute to both business and environmental sustainability.
</p>
<h4>Why Web Development?</h4>
<p>
  With extended periods at home between rotations, I want to use my time productively. Learning web 
  development allows me to build practical solutions, help businesses establish their online presence, 
  and contribute to projects that align with my values. Whether it’s creating websites for small businesses, 
  optimizing digital tools, or developing platforms for sustainability initiatives, I am excited about 
  the possibilities.
</p>
<h4>Beyond Work</h4>
<p>
  Outside of my professional life, I enjoy running, city trips, and reading. I also embrace Buddhist 
  principles, which guide me toward mindfulness and continuous personal growth. My passion for learning 
  drives me—not just for personal development, but to make a meaningful impact through technology, 
  education, and environmental restoration.
