<h1>The Best Movies According to Jan</h1>
<h2>My top 4 movies of all-time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Forrest Gump</h3>
<p>
    Life is like a box of cholates. You never know what you're gonna get. The famous quote
    in the movie says everything.
</p>
<h3>The Shawshank Redemption</h3>
<p>
    What I like is the friendship. And the movie has a small link to my personal past.
    When I was young me and my family we went every sunday between the age of 10 and 12,
    to a town that called Zihuatanejo. Which in the movie is the place Andy went when he
    escaped from Shawshank State PEmitentiary.
</p>
<p>
    Of course the iconic moments in the movie. Andy playing "The Marriage of Figaro"over the PA,
    The escape through a sewage tunnel and the iconic posters through the years. And then the
    the final reunion on the beach of Zihuatanejo, Mexico.
</p>
<h3>Dead Poets Society</h3>
<p>
    The theme of the movie hope and inspiration, and the unorthodox teacher who changes his
    students'lives through poetry is amazing.
</p>
<h3>Slumdog Millionaire</h3>
<p>How life brings you wisdom. </p>
